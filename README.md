This repository documents the steps I took for building a personal, modern, free and open source Security Operations Centre (SoC) lab at home!

Whether you're a blue team rookie or a seasoned cyber geek, this lab will help you level up your home defense game

<br>

üå∏ **Key Features**
</div>

- **Intelligent XDR**: Wazuh detects malware and **instantly** removes it
- **Next Generation Router**: pfSense is homelabbing done right :)
- **Web Security**: Wazuh detects any and all kinds of SQL attacks/ Arbitrary Input against web application
- **Robust Honeypot**: OpenCanary detects any interaction with the fake services and alerts Wazuh Server, which you can then hook into mail or discord
- **Red Team Campaigns**: Run automated scripts via Metasploit to perform Adversarial Campaigns

# 1. Problem Statement
</div>

Building a Security Operations Centre (SoC) at home presents challenges such as limited resources, tool integration, and complexity. This project provides a practical, cost-effective guide for setting up a modern SoC lab using open source technologies. Beginners can use this lab to showcase their knowledge and gain hands-on experience, while seasoned professionals can simulate and experiment with security solutions before deploying them in production environments.

# 2. Technical Overview

![Technical Image](assets/technicals.png)
</div>
This home lab Security Operations Centre (SoC) setup uses VirtualBox to host five virtual machines, each with a specific role:

- pfSense Router (`192.168.1.1`): Acts as the network gateway, routing traffic from *WAN* port and into your virtualbox's *Internal network*. Runs firewall and _IDS/IPS_ via *Snort*, can manage VPNs, and create DMZ to segregate the internal network
- Ubuntu Server (`192.168.1.25`): Running *Wazuh* *SIEM/XDR* for security operations management, the main machine managing the *SoC*
- Fedora Server (`192.168.1.42`): Honeypot server faking various services and forwarding traffic to the *Wazuh* server
- Windows 11 Machine (`192.168.1.11`): Simulates a user device, runs malware detection, and forwards events to the _SIEM_
- Kali Linux Machine (`192.168.1.8`): Adversary simulation device for running attack campaigns and testing detection capabilities

# 4. Pre Requisites

### Hardware Requirements
</div>

| Component | Minimum Specifications |
| ---- | ---- |
| Processor | Intel i5 10th Gen / AMD Ryzen 5 3600|
| Logical Processors (Threads) | 8|
| Memory | 16 GB DDR4 (at least 8GB **free** memory is required)|
| Storage Space | At least 128 GB free required|

# 6. Software Installation
</div>

### Step 6.1 ü§ñ: Install Oracle VirtualBox
Follow specific instructions for your main operating system to setup and install virtualbox, detailed walkthrough for this part is not covered

### Step 6.2 üìÄ: Download the Iso files
Download the guest operating systems image files (.iso) from the links given above
- Visit **pfSense website**, create an account, download the _netgate installer_ iso
- Visit **Ubuntu Downloads** page, get Ubuntu Server
- Visit Microsoft's **Download** page to obtain Windows 11's disk image
- Visit Fedora's **Web page** to download the Fedora Server ISO Image
- Visit Kali Linux's **download page**, click on **Pre-Configured** virtual machines, download one for virtualbox

### Step 6.3 üõú: Setting up the pfSense router

- Create a new Virtual Machine in VirtualBox of OS type: **BSD** and variant **FreeBSD** 64 bit. 
- Allocate just `512` MB of memory and `8 GB` storage.
- Configure **two** network adapters in VirtualBox settings:
    *   Adapter 1: Attached to `Bridged Adapter` (WAN)
    *   Adapter 2: Attached to `Internal Network` (LAN)
- Boot the VM from the ***Netgate Installer ISO***
- Follow the pfSense installer prompts
- When prompted, assign the first adapter (WAN) as `WAN` and the second adapter (LAN) as `LAN`
- Complete the installation and reboot
- Access the pfSense web interface through the LAN IP address to configure further

### Step 6.4 ü™ü: Setting up Windows 11 Virtual Machine
- Create a new Virtual Machine in VirtualBox, allocate `3172 MB` of RAM and `32 GB` of storage.
- Attach the first network adapter to `Internal Network` (_same network as LAN in pfSense_).
- Follow the Windows 11 installation prompts.
- Disable Windows Defender for testing purposes (not recommended in a production environment).
- Disable all updates to Windows Version
- Open Command Prompt and run `ipconfig` to verify the IP address and internet connectivity.
- (Optional) Set a static IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.11) to match the Windows version.

### Step 6.5 üêâ: Setting up Kali Linux Virtual Machine
- Unpack the downloaded zip file, double click on the blue icon file to automatically setup a vm entry in virtualbox
- Attach the first network adapter to `Internal Network` (Same Network as LAN in pfSense)
- Ensure networking is functional
- Update Kali and wait until the process to complete :)
```shell-session
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
- (Optional) Set a static IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.8)

### Step 6.6 üåê: Setting up Fedora Server (Honeypot)
- Create a new Virtual Machine in VirtualBox, OS type **Fedora** allocate `512 MB` of memory and `16 GB` storage
- Attach the first network adapter to "Internal Network" (Same Network as LAN in pfSense)
- Boot up the Fedora Server
- Update using
```shell-session
sudo dnf update
```
> - Make sure to hit y, as it's not the default selection


### Step 6.7: Setting up Ubuntu Server (Wazuh SIEM/XDR)
*   Create a new Ubuntu Virtual Machine in VirtualBox, allocate `3172 GB` memory and `32 GB` storage
*   Attach the first network adapter to `Internal Network` (Same Network as LAN in pfSense)
*   Boot up the Ubuntu Server and update the packages
```shell-session
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

*   Install wazuh manager
```bash
curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.12/wazuh-install.sh && sudo bash ./wazuh-install.sh -a
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Once the assistant finishes the installation, the output shows the access credentials and a message that confirms that the installation was successful

    ```shell-session
    INFO: --- Summary ---
    INFO: You can access the web interface https://         <WAZUH_DASHBOARD_IP_ADDRESS>
    User: admin
    Password: <ADMIN_PASSWORD>
    INFO: Installation finished.
    ```
